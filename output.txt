                                     (O/S)
                      ___________ |
                      |               |
                      |  Physical       |
                      |               |
                      v              v
                      | Internet         |
                      |   Layer 3        |
                      '_____________'  |
                      | Local Area Network (LAN)|
                      | (Switches)        |



Core Network Devices:
TSI's network infrastructure is built around several core network devices such as routers, switches, firewalls, and wireless access points. The company uses Cisco systems for their networking infrastructure due to its reliability, scalability, and extensive range of solutions. 

1. Routers: TSI utilizes multiple routers to ensure efficient routing of traffic between different networks within the organization. They use OSPF (Open Shortest Path Bridging) as an interior gateway protocol that provides fast convergence for multi-path routes.
2. Switches: The company employs a layer 3 switch infrastructure with access points connected via Ethernet cables. These switches support VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network), QoS (Quality of Service), and ACL (Access Control List) to manage traffic flow within the LAN.
3. Firewalls: TSI utilizes multiple firewalls at the perimeter level to provide network segmentation, secure remote access, and protect against cyber threats like DDoS attacks. The company uses a combination of hardware-based firewalls such as Cisco ASA (Adaptive Security Appliance) and software-defined firewalls such as Fortinet and Check Point.
4. Wireless Access Points: To ensure wireless connectivity within the organization's campuses, TSI has deployed a wireless infrastructure using Cisco Meraki access points. The company utilizes WPA3 encryption to secure wireless traffic and supports VLAN integration for segmenting traffic within the network.

Server Infrastructure:
TSI has invested heavily in its server infrastructure to provide efficient support for their various applications and services. They utilize several types of servers including domain controllers, file servers, application servers, and database servers.

1. Domain Controllers: The company uses Active Directory as their primary domain controller to manage user authentication, security, and group policies across all the Windows domains within the organization's network.
2. File Servers: TSI has deployed multiple file servers (SMB) for storing and sharing files within the organization using SharePoint for document management.
3. Application Servers: The company uses a combination of application servers such as Tomcat, JBoss, and IIS to host web applications like e-commerce platforms, intranet portals, and customer relationship management (CRM) systems.
4. Database Servers: TSI utilizes MySQL, Oracle, or Microsoft SQL Server for their database infrastructure, supporting various databases required by the organization's different departments and projects.

Cloud Services:
TSI has adopted a hybrid cloud approach to enhance its scalability, reliability, and cost-effectiveness. The company leverages multiple cloud service providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to deliver its services to clients worldwide. They utilize private and public cloud infrastructure depending on their specific needs for each client.

1. AWS: TSI utilizes Amazon EC2 instances and Elastic Load Balancer to provide flexible computing resources with high availability. The company also uses AWS Lambda functions and Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) to support its managed services offering.
2. Microsoft Azure: The organization leverages Azure ExpressRoute for reliable network connectivity between their data centers, VPN for secure remote access, and utilizes Azure Functions and Azure SQL Database for their cloud infrastructure requirements.
3. Google Cloud Platform (GCP): TSI uses GCP Compute Engine to deploy its web applications and services, along with Firestore NoSQL database and BigQuery for analytics purposes.

Security Measures:
TSI takes security measures very seriously to protect their clients' data and information assets. The company employs various security protocols such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), endpoint protection, regular security audits, and employee training programs to maintain a secure environment within the organization.

1. Multi-Factor Authentication: TSI requires all employees, contractors, and partners to use MFA for accessing their networks, applications, and cloud services. The company uses two-factor authentication (2FA) solutions such as Google Authenticator or Duo Security for added security.
2. Endpoint Protection: To prevent endpoint attacks like malware infections and phishing, TSI utilizes various endpoint protection solutions such as McAfee EAM (Enterprise Anti-Malware), Symantec Endpoint Detection Platform, and Sophos Central for comprehensive protection.
3. Regular Security Audits: The company conducts regular security audits of their IT infrastructure to identify vulnerabilities and ensure compliance with industry standards like PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) and ISO 27001 (International Organization for Standardization).
4. Employee Training Programs: TSI provides its employees with regular training programs on cybersecurity best practices, phishing awareness, and incident response procedures. The company also conducts periodic mock security audits to ensure compliance and identify potential areas of improvement.

Network Management:
To ensure the optimal performance and reliability of their IT infrastructure, TSI employs various network management tools such as Nagios, Zabbix, and SolarWinds Ping Sweep tool for monitoring its networks. These tools provide real-time visibility into network traffic and resource utilization, enabling proactive troubleshooting and problem resolution. Additionally, the company utilizes help desk software like Zendesk or ServiceNow to manage their IT service requests effectively.

In conclusion, Tech Solutions Incorporated has built a robust and secure infrastructure for providing innovative IT services across multiple industries. The organization's network topology, core devices, server infrastructure, cloud services, security measures, and network management strategies provide a solid foundation for growth, scalability, and
